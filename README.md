SLABot
=============

This is a small and immature project that tracks the oldest new issue in a **Shared HelpShift Queue.**

If you don't know what a Shared HelpShift queue is, this is not for you.


USAGE

Update the input file example accordinly and export the cURL (cmd) from chrome. Run the file and import the cURL file (NOTE: in UTF-8) format. 

And the [input file](https://github.com/mansueli/SLABot/tree/master/input%20example) as it is (Excel 1997-2003) .XLS. 

* PS: Don't forget to change the date on the cell B2, as this project relies on that to track.
* PS2: We track everything in PST time if you need to change that it should be easy peasy.
